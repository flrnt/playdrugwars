#dopewars - instructions

In Dopewars you are a drug dealer in New York. The aim of the game is to make lots and lots of money... Unfortunately the cops take a rather dim view of drug dealing, competition is murderous and your financiers are not always cooperative.


##Dealing drugs and moving around

The New York of dopewars is divided into 8 locations. At each of these locations, a variety of drugs, with fluctuating prices, are on sale. Not all of the drugs are necessarily on sale at each location all of the time, and the normally gentle fluctuations may be affected by such events as other dealers flooding the market with drugs, or the cops making a big drugs bust (which will drive the price up). On arriving at a new location, you will be told if any of these "special" events have occurred.

The main way to make money in dopewars is to buy and sell drugs, buying cheaply at one location, and then moving ("jetting") to a new location, and then selling for a profit at this new location. Bear in mind that you may not be able to afford or carry these drugs! You have limited space to carry drugs (indicated by the amount of space in the status overview on the right hand side).

You have to make al least 1 move once a week or else your account is deleted.

##Who is located where?

In different locations, there are special facilities you can visit:

the loan shark in the Bronx
the pub in the Ghetto
the hospital in Central Park
the bank in Manhattan
Dan's house of guns in Brooklyn

##Your finances: loans and banks

You start the game with a debt to the loan shark of $5,000. Every turn this accumulates interest, and counts against your total amount of money (which is used as your high score, so it's quite possible to have a negative score). Once a day extra interest is accumulated. To pay off the loan, you must visit the loan shark by jetting to the Bronx. Don't wait too long or the loan shark might come after you!

You can also deposit or withdraw money from the bank, which is located in Manhattan. Putting your money in the bank lets you accumulate interest on it, and prevents it from being stolen if you are mugged (which does occasionally happen). Interest on your bank account is added only once a day. Money in the bank also contributes to your high score.

If you have a very large amount of money (billions) on your bank account you risk forfeiture of a sum of money by the DEA.

##Cops, other dealers and the house of guns

When you jet to a new location, you may encounter the cops or another dealer. When you bought guns (at Dan's house of guns in Brooklyn), you can attack the cops or the other dealer, otherwise you will have to run. When you've all opponents you will receive the money they were carrying.

You may also surrender to the cops. Your time in jail will depend on the amount of drugs you were carrying and your behaviour during the fight. You lose any drugs or guns you might have.

If you have sufficient cash, you can also bribe the cops for $20,000 a cop. You also have to give half of the drugs you are carrying.

The damage you afflict depends on the value of your guns.

There are also a number of other beneficial, useless, or just plain annoying random events, when you jet to a new location.

##Bitches

In the pub (Ghetto) you can hire bitches for several purposes. The most important service a bitch can provide, is to carry drugs for you. One bitch can carry an extra amount of 10 drugs and 1 gun (you can carry 20 drugs and 2 guns yourself).

Your status (right hand side on the screen) shows how many bitches you have to carry drugs. These bitches can also catch bullets for you during fights, or even fire at your opponent when you buy them guns. If one of your bitches get killed however, you lose the drugs and gun the may be carrying.

When you start, you already have 2 bitches to carry drugs for you. If you hire many bitches they may run away.

##Health and the hospital

Dealing drugs can be very unhealthy. Fortunately you can have yourself fixed up at the hospital (Central Park). Make sure you stay healthy because a dead dealer's account is erased immediately. You can create a new account, but you will start at $0 again.
